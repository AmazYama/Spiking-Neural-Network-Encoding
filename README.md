# Spiking-Neural-Network-Encoding

## I wrote some code for Leaky-Integrated-Fire neural model, synapses' learning rule and temporal coding. 
- Parameters can be changed in parameters.py
- The rate coding happened from calling the neuron model. After the rate coding. The temporal coding which is inspired by the sound coding processing in brain was run. All start from file: Input_encoding.py
